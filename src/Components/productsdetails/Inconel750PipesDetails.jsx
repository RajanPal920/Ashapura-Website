              <h2>INCONEL X-750 PIPES – PRECIPITATION-HARDENED SUPERALLOY FOR EXTREME STRENGTH</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Inconel X-750</strong> (UNS N07750 / Werkstoff 2.4669) is a precipitation-hardenable nickel-chromium superalloy known for its outstanding strength, creep-rupture properties, and corrosion resistance at temperatures up to 700°C (1300°F). Unlike solid-solution alloys, Inconel X-750 gains its exceptional high-temperature strength through an age-hardening heat treatment, making it the preferred choice for the most demanding engineering applications.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <h3>SEAMLESS & WELDED INCONEL X-750 PIPES</h3>
              <p>
                We supply Inconel X-750 pipes in <strong>seamless (ASTM B983 / B167)</strong> and <strong>welded (ASTM B517)</strong> forms, available from ½" NB to 24" NB and schedules SCH 5 to SCH XXS. Our inventory includes solution-annealed pipes ready for fabrication, as well as fully age-hardened pipes for immediate service. We also offer ERW, EFW, and cold-drawn precision tubes.
              </p>
              <h3>APPLICATIONS & ADVANTAGES</h3>
              <p>
                Inconel X-750 is widely used in the <strong>aerospace</strong> sector for gas turbine engine components, combustors, and afterburners. It is also extensively used in <strong>nuclear reactors</strong> for control rod assemblies, in <strong>rocket engines</strong>, and for high-temperature springs and fasteners. Its resistance to relaxation and oxidation at elevated temperatures ensures long service life in critical, high-stress environments.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <h3>COMPLIANCE & STANDARDS</h3>
              <p>
                Our Inconel X-750 pipes are manufactured and tested in accordance with <strong>ASTM / ASME</strong> and <strong>AMS</strong> specifications, including <strong>ASTM B983, B517, B167</strong> and <strong>AMS 5582, AMS 5584</strong>. We provide comprehensive mill test certificates, PMI reports, heat treatment certification, and third-party inspection services.
