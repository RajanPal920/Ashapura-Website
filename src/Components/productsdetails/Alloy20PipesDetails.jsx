              <p>
                <strong>Alloy 20</strong> (UNS N08020 / Werkstoff 2.4660) is a nickel-iron-chromium austenitic alloy developed for maximum resistance to acid attack, especially sulfuric acid. It also offers excellent resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking and pitting, making it a preferred choice for chemical processing, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, food, and marine industries.

              <h3>SEAMLESS & WELDED ALLOY 20 PIPES</h3>
              <p>
                Our Alloy 20 pipes are available in <strong>seamless (ASTM B729)</strong> and <strong>welded (ASTM B464)</strong> forms, covering a wide range of sizes from ½" NB to 24" NB, and schedules from SCH 5 to SCH XXS. We also supply ERW, EFW, and electro-polished pipes for critical applications.
              </p>
              <h3>APPLICATIONS & ADVANTAGES</h3>
              <p>
                Alloy 20 pipes are widely used in sulfuric acid plants, pickling tanks, heat exchangers, condensers, and piping systems where resistance to strong oxidising and reducing acids is required. The alloy's controlled composition ensures long service life even under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <h3>COMPLIANCE & STANDARDS</h3>
              <p>
                Our Alloy 20 pipes are manufactured in strict accordance with <strong>ASTM / ASME</strong> specifications such as <strong>ASTM B729, B464, B163, B475</strong> and <strong>ASME SB729, SB464, SB163, SB475</strong>. We provide full material test certificates, PMI reports, and third-party inspections as required.
